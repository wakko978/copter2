    <strong>How do I design my alliance?</strong>
    <ul>
      In general, you will want to mirror one you have in CA. If the dropdowns are empty, that means you have no applicable generals in
			your inventory
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>How many can I create?</strong>
    <ul>
      As many as you like. Though, only a few make sense. Unfortunately, I cannot allow multiple alliances with the same general, so if a general is already in an alliance,
			it will not be available in the select list.

    <strong>Can I create alliances which don't exist in CA?</strong>

      Of course. Use this tool to test which alliances could be best.
